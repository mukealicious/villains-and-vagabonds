            <p>Appropriately dubbed "The Los Angeles Uprising", Los Angeles-based clothing label Villains &amp; Vagabonds has set out to create a collection to outfit the new generation of cultural pioneers. Drawing inspiration from the experimental art and music scene anchored in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, the team has created an inventive collection that evolves with each season containing men's and women's graphic tees and embellished cut and sew pieces. With a foundation based on strong design aesthetics and borderline-obsessive attention to detail, the collection is crafted in the V&amp;V design studio using innovative handmade applications developed over the years in their production studio. The strong designer-influenced background of the V&amp;V team flows through their work, intermixing high fashion with grittier street and punk styles. The unique fusion of elements results in a hard-edged yet attainable designer collection while ultimately staying true to the Los Angeles lifestyle.</p>
